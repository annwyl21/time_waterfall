# Time Waterfall

The "eternal luminance of human life". Japanese artist Tatsuo Miyajima's art of light, installation 'Time Waterfall' in the British Museum was inspiring and moving.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-JMlkH7_BA

I am neither copying nor recreating this beautiful art piece. I am a novice coder looking for inspiration to practice coding and feeling inspired by this art piece.

My code chooses the random number and counts down, never reaching zero and marches across the screen like cascading water. It is slow and peaceful while being beautiful.

What I learned:

- This is a tiny piece of code reinforcing that range produces an iterable and makes use of the print arguments.
