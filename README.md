# Time Waterfall

The "eternal luminance of human life". Japanese artist Tatsuo Miyajima's art of light, installation 'Time Waterfall' in the British Museum was inspiring and moving.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-JMlkH7_BA

I am neither copying nor recreating this beautiful art piece. I am a novice coder looking for inspiration to practice coding and feeling inspired by this art piece.

What I learned:

- This is an interesting piece of coding that reinforces that range produces an iterable and makes use of the print arguments.
